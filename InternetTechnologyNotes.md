# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Computers and the Internet

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language) : Specifies the **content** and **structure** of portable web pages.
* XHTML (eXtensible HTML)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) : Specifies the **presentation** and **styling** of portable web pages independent of content and structure.
* JavaScript : Used to build **dynamic** web pages that respond to **events** and for client side programming. ECMAScipt5 - latest version.
* jQuery : JavaScript library with more GUI features
* Validators : Used to ensure that browsers process our code properly.
* mailto:emailAddress : Can be used as a hyperlink to open the default mail program with the "To" address filled.
* URI : Uniform Resource Identifier - Provides the name of a resource.
* URL : Uniform Resource Locator - URIs that start with http:// - Along with the name of the resource, provides location as well. Subset of URIs.
* Path names in URLs are usually virtual directories to hide resources' true location. Web server translates the virtual directory into a real location.
* MIME type: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions type - Specifies data formats which programs use to interpret data correctly. eg. Content-type: text/html, Content-type: text/plain, Content-type: image/jpeg - Included in HTTP header.
* HTTP **get** request: Used to retrieve information from a web server. eg. HTML document, images, search results. - Used to send data by appending it to the URL. eg.www.google.com/search?q=deitel Character limit may be there for URL.
* HTTP **post** request: Used to send data to a server as part of the HTTP message, not the URL. Cannot be seen by a typical user. Used to send large amounts of information.
* Multitier applications : Each tier may reside in separate computers.
    * **Top tier** : Client tier - User interface - Retrieves and displays data.
    * **Middle tier**: Business logic - Controller logic - Presentation logic
    * **Bottom tier**: Data/information tier - Data typically stored in RDBMSs.
* Sensitive information like passwords should not processed/validated on the client's side. Client can view source. All validation must be mirrored on the server side.
* W3C - World Wide Web Consortium - Founded by Tim Berner's Lee in October 1994.
* Recommendations : Web technologies standardized by W3C.
